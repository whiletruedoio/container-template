# Container Template

Templates and examples for new container repositories.

## Motivation

Starting with containers can be intense and working towards best-practices is
often taking a lot of time. This learning can be a lot easier, if a project is
providing some pracices on its own and guiding new developers.

## Description

The code in this repository is not intended to be used directly. Instead, it
is providing some common scenarios and examples that may be handy, if one wants
to develop containers. Below, you can find a list of the provideded examples.

### Container

The container examples can be used with [Docker](https://docker.com),
[Podman](https://podman.io) or similar container engines and container
orchestration. You will also find the container images in our
[Docker Hub organization](https://hub.docker.com/u/whiletruedoio). You can find
more details about the container itself in the README for it.

- [Web Container](./container/web/)

### Kubernetes

The [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) examples demonstrate the usage of
different Kubernetes deployments and scenarios. All of them can be used on a
[k3s](https://k3s.io) cluster without any further tuning. The README for each
deployment will explain how it can be used.

## Contribute

Thank you so much for considering to contribute! We are happy, when someone is
joining the hard work.

### Issues

Issues and Pull Requests are handled on a regular basis. Please be aware, that
we may reach out to you, ask you to provide additional resources or want to
discuss the issue a little, before planning it.

- [Bugs and Feature Requests](https://github.com/whiletruedoio/container-template/issues)
- [Pull Requests](https://github.com/whiletruedoio/container-template/pulls)

### Develop

Providing code to this repository is pretty straight forward. Open an issue,
so we can discuss the bug/feature and start working on it afterwards. You just
need to open the pull request afterwards and that's it.

It is also strongly recommended to read the
[Contribution Guideline](https://github.com/whiletruedoio/.github/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
beforehand.

### Changelog

We are maintaining a [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for repositories. Normally, the
developers will update the changelog, according to
[keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/).

### Test

To ensure a high quality and functionality, we want to carefully test our
software.

<!-- TODO: Test

Add your guideline, how to test.
How to execute the tests locally?
What is automatically done?

Optional: Use and link a docs/TEST.md
Optional: Provide additional test scripts and helpers in tests/
