# Container Template

Templates and examples for new container repositories. 

## Motivation

Starting with containers can be intense and working towards best-practices is
often taking a lot of time. This learning can be a lot easier, if a project is
providing some pracices on its own and guiding new developers.

## Description

The code in this repository is not intended to be used directly. Instead, it
is providing some common scenarios and examples that may be handy, if one wants
to develop containers. Below, you can find a list of the provideded examples.

### Container

The container examples can be used with [Docker](https://docker.com),
[Podman](https://podman.io) or similar container engines and container
orchestration. You will also find the container images in our
[Docker Hub organization](https://hub.docker.com/u/whiletruedoio). You can find
more details about the container itself in the README for it.

### Kubernetes

The [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) examples demonstrate the usage of
different Kubernetes deployments and scenarios. All of them can be used on a
[k3s](https://k3s.io) cluster without any further tuning. The README for each
deployment will explain how it can be used.
